# Functional Requirements Specification: Auto-Analysis Dashboard MVP

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Product:** Alphatide Options Trading Dashboard

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision

An automated intelligence dashboard that continuously analyzes traders' watchlist tickers and presents actionable insights. The system replaces 20 minutes of manual research with instant, pre-processed intelligence.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition

**For every ticker, answer three questions:**

1. What changed?
2. Does it matter?
3. What should I do about it?

### 1.3 MVP Scope

- Single-page dashboard with market overview + ticker analysis sliders
- 4 autonomous analysis agents per ticker (Momentum, Flow, Volatility, Greeks)
- Automated confidence scoring and trading insights
- Alert system for meaningful changes
- Desktop-first responsive design
- Auto-refresh during market hours

---

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Primary User: Options Trader (Ankush)

**As an options trader, I want to:**

1. See overall market conditions at a glance so I understand the trading environment before analyzing individual tickers

2. Add tickers to my watchlist so I can monitor multiple opportunities simultaneously

3. See a traffic light summary for each ticker so I can quickly assess which setups are worth investigating

4. Get a confidence score for each ticker so I know how strong the setup is before trading

5. Expand any ticker to see detailed reasoning from each analysis agent so I understand the "why" behind the signals

6. Receive real-time alerts when significant changes occur so I don't miss important developments

7. Get clear trading guidance ("what should I do") so I can make faster decisions

8. Reorder my watchlist so my most important tickers are at the top

9. Have the system continuously update during market hours so I don't have to manually refresh

10. Access this dashboard on both desktop and mobile so I can trade from anywhere

---

## 5. API Integration Requirements

### 5.1 OpenAI Agent Workflow Architecture

**INT-1: Agent API Endpoints**

- Each agent (Momentum, Flow, Volatility, Greeks) is an OpenAI agent workflow
- Frontend calls agent-specific endpoints: `/api/agents/{agent_type}/{ticker}`
- Agent types: `momentum`, `flow`, `volatility`, `greeks`
- All endpoints return structured JSON (see INT-2 for schema)

**INT-2: Agent Response Schema**

Each agent endpoint MUST return JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "agent_type": "momentum",
  "status": "Strong Up",
  "confidence_contribution": 23,
  "data_points": [
    { "label": "Price Trend", "value": "+2.3% (Bullish)" },
    { "label": "Volume", "value": "125% above average" },
    { "label": "Relative Strength", "value": "Outperforming SPY by 1.8%" }
  ],
  "what_changed": "Price broke above 20-day resistance with strong volume",
  "does_it_matter": "Yes - breakout on heavy volume suggests institutional interest",
  "what_to_do": "Consider bullish positions; watch for pullback to $175 support",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type": "breakout",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Breakout above $180 resistance on 2x average volume",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-17T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-10-17T14:35:12Z",
  "error": null
}
```

Error response format:
```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "agent_type": "momentum",
  "error": "API rate limit exceeded",
  "last_known_good_data": { /* cached response */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T14:35:12Z"
}
```

**INT-3: Backend Agent Tool Usage**

- Each OpenAI agent workflow MUST use existing Alphatide tools:
  - Momentum Agent: `get_price_context_charts`, `get_last_trading_day_price`
  - Flow Agent: `analyze_flow_data`, `get_nope_data`, `get_recent_darkpool_trades`
  - Volatility Agent: `analyze_volatility_comprehensive`
  - Greeks Agent: `analyze_greeks_exposure`, `analyze_max_pain`, `analyze_oi_data`
- System MUST NOT create new data sources for MVP
- Backend MAY cache tool responses to reduce redundant API calls

**INT-4: Rate Limiting & Error Handling**

- Frontend MUST respect API rate limits
- Frontend MUST implement exponential backoff on failures
- Frontend MUST queue requests if needed to avoid exceeding concurrent request limits
- Backend MUST return HTTP 429 when rate limited with Retry-After header
- Backend MUST return cached data with error flag when API unavailable

**INT-5: Data Freshness**

- Backend MUST use most recent available market data
- Backend MUST indicate data staleness in response if source API unavailable
- Backend SHOULD cache analysis results for up to 5 minutes to reduce load
- Frontend MUST display timestamp for each agent's last successful update

---

## 6. Success Criteria

**Success means:**

- Reduce pre-trade analysis time from 20 minutes to <5 minutes
- Provide confidence scores that influence 40-85% of trade decisions (matches current Alphatide usage)
- Alert users to meaningful changes within 60 seconds
- 80% of users keep dashboard open during entire trading session

### 6.2 Technical Metrics

**Success means:**

- <2 second initial load time
- <5 second agent analysis completion
- 99% uptime during market hours
- <1% error rate on API calls

### 6.3 Feature Adoption

**Success means:**

- Average 8-12 tickers per user watchlist

- 60%+ of users act on trading insights
- Alert engagement rate >50%

---

## 7. Out of Scope (Not in MVP)

**The following are explicitly NOT included in MVP:**

- Real-time WebSocket updates (will use polling)
- Historical playback of analysis
- Backtesting features
- Multiple watchlist management
- Custom agent configuration
- Portfolio tracking
- Trade execution
- Social/sharing features
- Advanced charting
- Mobile native apps (responsive web only)
- Notifications outside the app
- API webhooks
- White-label capabilities

These MAY be considered for future versions based on MVP feedback.

---

## 8. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

**Q1: Single vs Multiple Expanded Tickers**

- Should only one ticker be expandable at a time, or allow multiple?
- **Recommendation**: Start with single (reduces cognitive load)

**Q2: Real-time vs Polling**

- WebSocket for instant updates or HTTP polling for simplicity?
- **Recommendation**: HTTP polling for MVP (every agent has different interval anyway)

**Q3: Alert Notification Method**

- In-app only or also browser notifications?
- **Recommendation**: In-app only for MVP

**Q4: Watchlist Limit**

- How many tickers should we allow per user?
- **Recommendation**: 20 for MVP (can adjust based on performance)

**Q5: Market Data During Closed Hours**

- Should agents run when market is closed?
- **Recommendation**: Reduce frequency but keep monitoring (pre-market prep is valuable)

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

**The MVP is complete when:**

âœ… User can add/remove tickers to watchlist  
âœ… Dashboard shows market overview (SPY/QQQ/VIX)  
âœ… Each ticker shows confidence score and 4 status indicators  
âœ… User can expand ticker to see detailed agent analysis  
âœ… Each agent provides "what changed, does it matter, what to do" guidance  
âœ… Trading insight synthesizes all agents into actionable advice  
âœ… Alerts are generated and displayed for significant changes  
âœ… Dashboard auto-refreshes during market hours  
âœ… Works on desktop and mobile browsers  
âœ… Loads in <2 seconds, updates in <5 seconds  
âœ… Handles errors gracefully (shows cached data)
