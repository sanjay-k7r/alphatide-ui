A regular situation for Ankush, an options trader
TODAY Normal - Ankush has returned from office and is sitting down to trade for the day. It is 6pm Tuesday.

He has seen the TradingView chart. He has seen the breakout breakdown patterns. He wants to observe how the stock is flowing. He is also looking at other indices e.g. QQQ, SPY, VIX to see how they are performing. He would look at Meta, AMD and other tickers that have momentum running in them. Not all tickers will have momentum in them. (~ 20 mins)

Then

Where he sees momentum, he will use Alphatide. Or even on QQQ, as guidance from Alphatide on broad index is very helpful.

Even if there is less momentum, there is options pressure, darkpool activity, gamma walls, gamma position, NOPE analysis (v.imp), 5-15-1hr price context, volatility - will look for guidance from alphatide

When there is substantial momentum, i want to know if alphatide can provide me, the gamma squeeze potential levels % wise for today

He opens up Alphatide to select a Ticker that he wants to know more about before taking a trading position.

Then Ankush decides on what position to take, Alphatide plays a 40-85% role in helping to decide.
